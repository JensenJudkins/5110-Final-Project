Why we are interested in the subject?
As cyber criminals become more skilled and cyber attacks continue to escalate, the need for a more robust cyber security strategy intensifies. Using game theory to implement cyber security protocols, would ensure scalability, robustness, flexibility, and efficiency.  
	Perhaps implementing a strategy that would decrease an actor’s motivation to attack a system would be more beneficial than trying to protect against the many different ways a system could be attacked. This could be implemented by using several different strategies in Game Theory. Every defense is going to have a weak point, so the purpose of our project will focus on minimizing the damage done when the attacker’s strategy outwits the defender’s strategy.
What benefits this subject could gain from our research?
By developing robust cybersecurity strategies informed by game theory, we aim to save consumers, governments, and businesses significant time and money. According to a survey conducted by the National University of Singapore and the International Data Corporation, security breaches and malware cost around $491 billion in 2014. It was also estimated that consumers would likely spend $25 billion to mitigate threats and 1.2 billion hours would be wasted dealing with the after-effects. 
How do we plan to implement game theory?
	We propose utilizing multi-player game simulations to devise defense strategies. By modeling the strategic interactions between the “attacker” and the “defenders” who’s objectives and rewards directly conflict. We hope to observe what the optimal defensive strategies are and to anticipate not only the attacker’s next move but also the position that the defender is in, with regards to their own defensive position in comparison to their peers.  In general, the attacker focuses on causing maximum corruption in cyberspace (and being rewarded for doing so) while the defender aims to conduct its business and make money while not being the target for the attackers (and putting their rewards at risk of theft). This will allow us to better understand the dynamics of cybercrime. 
This paper contains many examples of how Game Theory has been implemented in cyber security. The authors explicitly state that none of the strategies they listed are complete, and we aim to perform an experiment on the “Markovian Game” model. 
How has this topic been studied previously?
Yes, implementing game theory in cyber security has been studied previously, however, an absolute solution has not yet been discovered.
